## 📖 About
**GraphAIne** is a deep learning framework for **graphene plasmonics** using **neural networks**.  
It predicts **atomic charge distributions** based on **frequency-dependent interactions** in graphene nanostructures.  

This framework uses **feedforward neural networks (FNNs)** to model atomic-level charge responses  
and is designed to handle large-scale **graphene-based molecular simulations**.
